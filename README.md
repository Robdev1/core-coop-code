# core-coop-code
Basic financial and group structure functions organized in a way that a co-operative venture can make use of them.

The first installment of the code looks at the financial contributions (eg. investments broadly speaking) that cooperative members need to make in order to acquire an amount of capital.
The code then makes a basic analysis of the percentage ownership of the cooperative, based on three scenarios.

Scenario 1: EGALITARIAN

This is the simplest analysis. Everyone contributes that same amount and is assigned the same percentage ownership.
The code calculates what that amount and that percentage is.
Please note that this code will be very useful in any scenario where the cooperative issues shares in equal proportions. In those other scenarios people may elect to invest in varying numbers of shares, thereby creating a cooperative where some people have more ownership than others. But the shares themselves will have equal value, and this code can be used to calculate that value.

Scenario 2: MAJORDOMO with 51% OWNERSHIP

This scenario analyzes the effect of one person having majority control. The initial code looks at the simplest example: a majordomo with 51% ownership and everyone else having equal portions of the remainder.

Scenario 3: 4321 4-MEMBER BREAKDOWN

This scenarios looks at a four-member group with the ownership alignment being 40%, 30%, 20% and 10%. It is the first step in analyzing a cooperative in which there is a significant difference in the percentage ownership among all members.

FUTURE STEPS:

Later this code will grow into an integrated suite that could:
* Easily determine contribution levels and percentage ownership for wide ranges of membership levels and participation.
* Calculate the return on investment or member rebates based on percentage ownership.
* Establish simple and then progressively sophisticated bookkeeping and accounting software that could generate
   * balance sheets
   * operating statements
   * forecasts
  
Further database management code could be developed and integrated to:
* connect to bylaws and other governing documents
* create records for each member
* create records for daily activities
* create schedules for tasks to be performed and to track said performance
* maintain an inventory of property of the cooperative
* tie into utility usage or any other energy- or water-using equipment that is readily monitored by sensors
* connect to the Web site or other electronic communication system of the cooperative
* connect with CRMs for contractor and vendor relationships

Finally, this project is designed for a self-managed cooperative. If non-members are hired to perform tasks, a an important fork should be developed to manage the payroll and employment functions of that relationship.
